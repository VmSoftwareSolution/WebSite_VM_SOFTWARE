 # Branch Naming Convention
 In our project, we adhere to well-defined branch naming conventions to ensure a consistent and organized workflow. Our branch names are structured to provide clear information about their purpose and context.

[type]-[hu-name]-[plane]

## Naming Format

Our branch names follow the format:

- **`type`**: Represents the type of branch. We use `FT` for Feature branches.

- **`hu-name`**: Stands for the Hypothetical User Story name, which provides context for the branch.

- **`plane`**: Indicates the plane number associated with the task or issue.
## Examples

- **Feature Branch Example :**
  - Branch Name: `FT-VM-PAGE-2`
  - Purpose: Implementation of a feature tied to task `VM-PAGE-2`.

By adhering to these branch naming conventions, we enhance clarity and traceability within our development process.
